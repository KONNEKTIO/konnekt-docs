Prerequisites & Vendor Onboarding

In order to purchase KONNEKT from our merchant of record, cleverbride GmbH (headquartered in Germany), no special prerequisites have to be met, except for accepting their terms and conditions.

Depending on your sourcing and purchasing requirements, you might have to set up cleverbridge as a vendor in your system. cleverbridge provides all relevant onboarding information [via their website](https://support.cleverbridge.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405420244243-How-do-I-register-Cleverbridge-as-a-vendor).

Should you have any questions during the onboarding process, especially in regards to legal or taxation aspects, please [contact cleverbridge directly](cleverbridge.md#for-what-inquiries-should-i-contact-cleverbridge-directly).

{% hint style="info" %}
**For US-based customers only**.

Since cleverbridge operates a local entity in the US, cleverbridge Inc., certain tax implications may arise from this. As part of their vendor [onboarding information](https://support.cleverbridge.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405449389587-I-m-a-vendor-looking-to-place-an-order-from-the-U-S-What-documents-do-I-need), they also provide a W-9 form.

## Subscription Management

### Self-management Portal

Cleverbridge allows you to manage any aspect of your subscription via their self-management portal, including but not limited to:

* Contact data changes
* Payment method changes
* Downloading previous invoices
* Performing user upgrades and downgrades
* Cancelling your subscription

To access the self management portal, please refer to the initial delivery / order confirmation email that was sent to you by cleverbridge at the time your order was placed. Within that email, locate the button saying **Manage Your Subscription For "\<SKU>"** and click it.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This will either navigate you to the self-management portal directly or you might have to re-generate the link (they might expire after a while) first.

{% hint style="info" %}
In case you are having difficulties accessing the self-management portal as described above, feel free to [contact cleverbridge directly](cleverbridge.md#for-what-inquiries-should-i-contact-cleverbridge-directly) for assistance by referencing your **Cleverbridge reference number**.
{% endhint %}

### User Upgrades

{% hint style="info" %}
User upgrades are only available if all previous amounts / invoices have been paid. In case you cannot pay a previous invoice before performing the upgrade, please [contact us](mailto:sales@konnekt.io).
{% endhint %}

#### Mid-term Upgrade

{% hint style="info" %}
The Mid-term Upgrade option is **available until 15 days before** your subscription is set to renew. Afterwards it will be replace by the [Early Renewal Upgrade](cleverbridge.md#early-renewal-upgrade).
{% endhint %}

If you would like to upgrade your user count, you can do so any time during the current subscription cycle by navigating to the subscription's [self-management portal](cleverbridge.md#self-management-portal) leveraging the mid-term upgrade option.

With the mid-term upgrade, additional users will be&#x20;

* billed **Pro Rata Temporis**, and
* **co-termed** with the existing users,

which means you only pay for the delta in users pro-rated for the remaining subscription cycle.

To perform a mid-term upgrade,

* Navigate to the subscription's [self-management portal](cleverbridge.md#self-management-portal).
* Click **Manage products**.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

*   Select the correct [user segment](cleverbridge.md#user-segments), and provide the new **total** number of users. The website will display the&#x20;

    * upgrade price (**Upgrade price today**), and
    * the next regular renewal price assuming the new total user count (**Renewal price on ...**)

    both **including VAT**.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Click **Next**, review your **Payment method** and confirm the purchase by clicking **Buy now**.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* The additional users will be added to your **existing KONNEKT license key** automatically.

#### Early Renewal Upgrade

{% hint style="info" %}
The Early Renewal Upgrade flow is **available from 15 days before** your subscription is set to renew.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you would like to upgrade your user count as part of the next regular renewal, you can do so by navigating to the subscription's [self-management portal](cleverbridge.md#self-management-portal) leveraging the early renewal upgrade flow.

With the early renewal upgrade flow, additional users are **pre-registered** for the next regular renewal. However, you may start using the additional users immediately.

To perform an early renewal upgrade,

* Navigate to the subscription's [self-management portal](cleverbridge.md#self-management-portal).
* Click **Renew subscription**.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Select the correct [user segment](cleverbridge.md#user-segments), and provide the new **total** number of users. The website will display the renewal price considering the additional users.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Click **Next**, review your **Payment method** and confirm the purchase by clicking **Buy now**.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* The additional users will be added to your **existing KONNEKT license key** automatically.

### User Downgrades

You can pre-register a reduction of your user count for the next regular renewal by leveraging the [early renewal upgrade](cleverbridge.md#early-renewal-upgrade), too. However instead of adding users, you may reduce the number of users.

### **Automatic Renewal**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only relevant for customers buying in non-Euro currency.

By disabling Automatic Renewal you **are opting out of the perpetual forex rate** guarantee. This means the forex risk is transferred from cleverbridge to the customer.
{% endhint %}

If you decide to disable **Automatic Renewal**, your subscription will not renew automatically. Instead, cleverbridge will (irreversibly) cancel the subscription towards the end of the current subscription cycle. This means, the service will be terminated automatically on that date as well. While the subscription has not expired yet, you can opt to enable **Automatic Renewal** at any time by navigating to your subscription's [self-management portal](cleverbridge.md#self-management-portal).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Cancellation

* If you would like to (irreversibly) cancel your subscription, navigate to your subscription's [self-management portal](cleverbridge.md#self-management-portal) and disable **Automatic Renewal**.
* You subscription will expire towards the end of the current cycle.
* There is **no cancellation notice period**.
