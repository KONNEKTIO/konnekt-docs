# Debug log preparation

Our support team may ask you to provide debug logs to analyze issues. To do so, please follow these steps:

## **1) Set Log-Level to Debug:**

Right-Click on the KONNEKT Tray Icon and choose "Preferences"\


![](<../../.gitbook/assets/2022-08-02 17_01_27-Window.png>)

Set Log-Level to "Debug":

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/2022-08-02 17_02_06-Window.png>)

## 2) Restart the affected machine

## 3) Try to reproduce the Issue

When trying to reproduce the problem, please note the use case you are trying. A description of the steps with details of the path, file name, and timestamp is very helpful when troubleshooting.

## 4) Wait a moment and close KONNEKT

## 5) Collect the logs

Run crashguard.exe and click "Send report":

"C:\Program Files\Konnekt\crashguard.exe"

In certain situations, a report cannot be sent due to company restrictions. In such cases, an email window may appear, or the new zipped folder will be saved on your Desktop.

## 6) Send to us

After submitting the report, please send us a brief email:

* Use case / what went wrong?
* Timestamp / when did it happen?
* Path / file name
