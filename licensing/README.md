# Licensing

{% hint style="success" %}
The subscription for KONNEKT is **user-based**.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## User definition

The licensing is per seat, which means that the subscription of a "user" is required for each user (UPN), who is using KONNEKT to log into OneDrive for Business or SharePoint online.

{% hint style="info" %}
In many cases the required amount of KONNEKT subscriptions equals the amount of Microsoft Office 365 / OneDrive for Business / SharePoint Online subscriptions.
{% endhint %}

The minimum amount of users that can be subscribed for one organization is 25.

A user subscription is bound to a single user for at least one calendar month and cannot be shared with other users.

## Device limits per user

A single user may have up to 5 Windows devices or VDI sessions (e.g. Citrix XenApp).

## Subscription scope

It is **not** allowed to&#x20;

* use one KONNEKT subscription for users from multiple organizations,
* split one KONNEKT subscription and/or re-sell it to multiple organizations.
