Set Log-Level to "Debug":

![](<../.gitbook/assets/2022-08-02 17\_02\_06-Window.png>)

## 2) Restart the affected machine

## 3) Try to reproduce the Issue

When trying to reproduce the problem, please note the use case you are trying. A description of the steps with details of the path, file name, and timestamp is very helpful when troubleshooting.

## 4) Close KONNEKT

## 5) Download and run the following batch file

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/KONNEKT-debug-20220330.zip" %}

## 6) Zip the files

You'll find the collected files in:

```
%UserProfile%\KONNEKT
```

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (30).png>)

Please zip the whole folder.

## 7) Send to us

* Zip folder from 6)
